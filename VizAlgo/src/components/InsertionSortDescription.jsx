          Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that
          builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by
          repeatedly taking an unsorted element and inserting it into the
          correct position within the sorted part of the list. This process is
          repeated until the entire list is sorted.

        <p>
          Although it is easy to implement and efficient for small datasets,
          Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the worst case,
          making it inefficient for large datasets. It is often used for sorting
          small arrays or as part of more advanced algorithms.
