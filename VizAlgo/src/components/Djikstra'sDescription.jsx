        <p>
          Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest
          paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road
          networks. It works by selecting the node with the smallest tentative
          distance, exploring its neighbors, and updating their distances. This
          process continues until the algorithm has found the shortest path to
          all nodes or reached the destination node.

        <p>
          It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in weighted
          graphs with non-negative edge weights. Dijkstra's Algorithm is widely
          used in networking, map routing, and GPS systems. Its time complexity
          is O(VÂ²) with a simple implementation but can be improved to O(E + V
          log V) using priority queues.
